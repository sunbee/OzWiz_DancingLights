    "In the old days, a taxi-meter had a flag to indicate whether a taxi was vacant or not. Once the taxi had a fare, the operator manually rotated the flag to indicate the taxi was not available any more. A GPIO pin has a similar function as the taxi-meter flag. It conveys a simple dichotomous message - high or low. ![Flag](images/taxi_meter_flag.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a sensor conveys information to the Pi, it puts a \"high\" or \"low\" message on a GPIO pin. Thus a temperature sensor may indicate high or low temperature. Or a moisture sensor may indicate dry or wet soil. To recieve information, a GPIO pin must be in listening mode, i.e. \"input\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Pi can energize an actuator via GPIO pin by putting a \"high\" or \"low\" message on a GPIO pin. GPIO \"high\" and \"low\" signals tell hardware to switch on and off. To send information, a GPIO pin must be in transmitting mode, i.e. \"output\". \n",

    "So far, we have operated an LED from the Pi using a GPIO pin. The GPIO \"high\" of 3.3 V was sufficient to power the LED which requires very little power to run. In practical applications, the GPIO pin is rarely used to supply a device directly. A more general approach is to supply a device's power requirement independently of the Pi and use GPIO logic to operate an on-off switch in the device's voltage feed to control it. This approach is versatile and opens up the possibility of controlling devices with power requirement beyond that which the Pi can supply, including home appliances (like a gas furnace or a washing machine) that draw power from the mains.\n",
