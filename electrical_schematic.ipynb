    "A maker project is a system with components that exchange messages with the Pi. Sensors convey messages about external conditions like temperature, light and pressure. An actuator, such as motor, receives a message to energize. The GPIO pins provide the interface for exchanging messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the old days, a taxi-meter had a flag to indicate whether a taxi was vacant or not. Once the taxi had a fare, the operator manually rotated the flag to indicate the taxi was not available any more. A GPIO pin has a similar function as the taxi-meter flag. It conveys a simple dichotomous message - high or low. ![Flag](images/taxi_meter_flag.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a sensor conveys information to the Pi, it puts a \"high\" or \"low\" message on a GPIO pin. Thus a temperature sensor may indicate high or low temperature. Or a moisture sensor may indicate dry or wet soil. To recieve information, a GPIO pin must be in listening mode, i.e. \"input\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the Pi can energize an actuator via GPIO pin by putting a \"high\" or \"low\" message on a GPIO pin connected to the device. To send information, a GPIO pin must be in transmitting mode, i.e. \"output\". A GPIO pin may directly supply power to a low-power device, like an LED light. More often, the device's power requirements dictate that it draw power from a source independent of the Pi. In that case, the GPIO pin operates a low-power switch that controls the device. In this way, a Pi can control an appliance around the home, like a gas furnace or a washing machine, which draws power from the mains supply."

    "## Relay GPIO Signals to High-Voltage Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have operated an LED from the Pi using a GPIO pin. The GPIO \"high\" of 3.3 V was sufficient to power the LED which requires very little power to run. In practical applications, the GPIO pin is rarely used to supply a device directly. A better approach is to use GPIO to operate a switch that controls a device's voltage feed. This approach is versatile, since it opens up the possibility of controlling devices with GPIO logic regardless of power requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a relay comes in the picture. A relay is an electrically operated switch. The simplest design have an electro-mechanical design. The signal activates an electromagnet that closes contacts against opposing spring action. In the absence of signal, the contacts snap open. This type of relay is a popular choice among makers. They are also available as a \"HAT\" which mates with the Pi's bank of GPIO pins.\n",

The versatility of this approach is seen from the modification of this circuit to operate a lamp supplied from the mains. An electromechanical relay makes it possible to operate (i.e. switch on or off) any appliance with very little effort. Simply splice a relay into the power cable as shown and operate the relay with GPIO signal. For more than one device, use the Pi HAT.\n",
