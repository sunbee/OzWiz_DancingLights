## Fire up your neurons and light up my world, precious nerds! ##

Make a motion-activated light that comes on in the dark so as to comfort a child waking up at night. Follow the **electrical schematic** to wire up components, inclduing Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor and MOSFETs, so as to detect motion in the dark. Follow the **digital schematic** to program the Pi to read sensor input and switch on LED lights. Follow the **mechanical schematic** to assemble a product that can be placed on the bed-side.
